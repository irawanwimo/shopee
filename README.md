## Intro

This is my first time for coding in React. And I hope I could learn more about it.
I used a lot of references to this test. Mostly are from youtube and stackoverflow.


## What's missing?

I haven't "dockerize" this react app. In my experience using Docker, I only use it for "docker-compose-up" and "down". But it amuses me to build or deploy an app in docker by myself. I'll update if I'm successfully "dockerize" this project.
